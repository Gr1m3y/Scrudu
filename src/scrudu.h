// A minimal unit testing framework.
//
// Scrudu is a lightweight framework for testing C projects. It started as a
// unit testing framework based on MinUnit
// (http://www.jera.com/techinfo/jtns/jtn002.html)
// It has since evolved, and I plan on letting it continually evolve as I find
// different functionality that I would like to include. I hope that it finds
// use somewhere. For more information, view the documentation.
